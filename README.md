# alg-lang
This contains many popular algorithm implementations in 3 languages-Python. Javascript, Java

There's a generator file which takes as input the size of random numbers to generate. These numbers are written to a file - 'ints'

A shell script 'executor' can be invoked with an input size. All possible sort options are shown and choice has to be entered. Then that sort algorithm will be run in three different implementations/languages. Their running time for sort operation will be shown. Also additional proccessing time (reading numbers from file, etc) is tracked per language.
